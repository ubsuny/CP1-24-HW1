# Background of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen Paradox #

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 15th 1935 Albert Einstein published the paper "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical 
Reality Be Considered Complete?" alongside his associates Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen begin this paper by plainly explaining a paradox in Quantum Mechanics as follows:

> "In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand what they meant we must first understand as best as we can a few fundamental ideas in quantum mechanics and the founding issues Einstein and his collegues had with them. In Quantum Mechanics a quantum mechanical object, let's refer to it as a particle, can be described probabilistically by a wave function. This means that any observable measurment of said particle is only finite and measurable after a measurment has been taken. Before that measurement the particle has a probability of being any number of possible outcomes defined by a function. Afterward the wave function would "collapse" into a single value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner Heisenberg would later go on to theorize that after the first mesurment was mad and the value defined, if a second measurement were made and defined the first measurment were retaken, then the supposedly fixed first value could be measured differently. The first value is "reset" back to the probabilistic wave function. This meant that measurments themselves were uncertain if further measurments of different factors are taken. This is refered to as the Heisenberg Unertainty Principle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly Erwin Schrödinger had a famous though experiment where he posited that a cat in a contained box that could not be looked into and a radioactive souce connected to a hammer over a sealed vial of poison would randomly be broken by the hammer killing the cat. This meant that while the box was unopened no outside observer could know whether the cat was alive or dead and therefore until the box is opened and a definite measurment taken the cat is both alive and dead. Both states held in what he called "superposition". Because of the feline subject, this thought experiment is refered to as "Schrödinger's Cat".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen perform a similar thought experiment. A pair of quantum particles are taken from the same source and are linked or "entangled". This means that when a measurment of the same observable is performed on both particles the value is always the same even if the value is "reset" using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This also means that a measurement of one particle will always tell us the measurment of the other, even before a measurment on particle 2 can be performed. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen had to major problems with this as well as Quantum Mechanics. Einstein believed that...

> "Any serious consideration of a physical theory must take into account the distinction between the objective reality, which is independent of any theory, and the physical concepts with which the theory operates. These concepts are intended to correspond with the objective reality, and by means of these concepts we picture this reality to ourselves."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Einstein, A., et al. “Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?” Physical Review, vol. 47, no. 10, 15 May 1935, pp. 777–780, https://doi.org/10.1103/physrev.47.777.*

This was a widely held belief that objects in nature are strictly predefined whether or not there is an observer or a theory to define them. Popularly that if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, it still makes a sound. Einstein felt the inditerminite nature of quantum mechanical theory ran opposite to this. He along with Podolsky and Rosen also believed that if there were no predefined property of of a quantum system then entaglement was incombatible with Einstein's theory of relativity. This is what they outline in their paper. Since there is no maximum distance two entangled particles can be from each other and still be entangled hen they shouldn't be able to send information instantaniously to each other. Say we have two entangled particles. One on the Earth and one on the Moon and they both attatched to measurement devices. Then a scientist here on Earth measures the first entangled particle and one nanosecond later the other scientitst on the moon measures the second particle. Both measurments are identicle because the pair is entangled. Einstein says this is impossible because the first particle must inform the second what it has been measured as so they can be identical, but for that to be true the information would have to travel faster than the speed of light to beat the one nanosecond later measurement the second scientist makes. This breaks the thory of relativity that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. So Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen believe that either there is a secret property that is not described in Quantum Mechanis or the two particles are not simultaneously entangled. This is the paradox as laid out in the paper. This conclusion would stand unchallenged until John Stewart Bell would publish a paper contradicting the EPR paradox in 1964.
