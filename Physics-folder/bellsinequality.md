# BELL'S INEQUALITY

University at Buffalo

The CHSH inequality also known as the Bell's inequality is a fundamental concept in quantum
mechanics to test the phenomenon of quantum entanglement and whether the universe obeys local
realism. 

For this inequality we consider two particles both spacially seperated, we'll call them A and B. Both A and B can have two different outcomes lets just say A can be either be + or - 1 and B can also be either + or - 1. If we implement the CHSH inequality which is as follows:

A0(B0 + B1) + A1(B0 - B1)

A0 = 1, A1 = -1, B0 = 1, B1 = -1, then we can assume the outcome will always be less than or equal to two, in other words the upperbound will always be two. This is known as the CHSH inequality. sdfadf
